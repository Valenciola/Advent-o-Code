<h1 align="center">🎄 Advent of Code! 🎄</h1>

Welcome to my repository for the Advent of Code (AoC) challenges!

This is my first year participating in this code puzzle challenge, so I'm gonna keep all of my code and puzzle inputs in here.

## The Experience 🎀

Since it's my first time doing this, I decided to write down my experience for each day I complete a puzzle. You can read about today's experience [**here**](https://github.com/Valenciola/Advent-o-Code/blob/main/Experience.md#day-4---12423).

You can also check out the full document, [**Experience.md**](https://github.com/Valenciola/Advent-o-Code/blob/main/Experience.md).

## Exploring the Repo 🚀

Instead of separating my repository by day, I separated them into inputs and solutions. You can see today's solution [**here**](https://github.com/Valenciola/Advent-o-Code/blob/main/Solutions/Chal4.py). My programs aren't very well-commented so far, but feel free to take a look anyway and see if you can see what I'm doing.

I also didn't quite separate my solutions into part 1 and part 2, but you can go into the history and see it marked there.

If you're interested in trying out a code puzzle of your own, go and check out [**Advent of Code**](https://adventofcode.com/2023)! Who knows, you might really enjoy yourself in the end 😉

**Happy Holidays!** ❄️

*(Side note: I kinda did all this because I felt a weird urge to one-up my friend ZLT (referring to him that way for privacy). Maybe I did?)*
