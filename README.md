<h1 align="center">🎄 Advent of Code! 🎄</h1>

Welcome to my repository for the Advent of Code (AoC) challenges!

We're back for **2024!**

## Details
I'm tackling AoC in the **Python** language. It might seem like the easy way out because it's got a lot of convenient methods but my goal this year is to actually *finish* a year of AoC this time around...

## And so...
If you're interested in trying out a code puzzle of your own, go and check out [**Advent of Code**](https://adventofcode.com/2023)! Who knows, you might really enjoy yourself in the end (wayyyy in the end, even) 😉

**Happy Holidays!** ❄️
